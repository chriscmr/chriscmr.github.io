Welcome to this website!, I am from Cameroon, currently pursuing a Master's degree program in Data Science at AIMS (African Institute for Mathematical Sciences) in Rwanda. It was during my undergraduate studies in Applied Mathematics (in Cameroon) that I became interested in Numerical Analysis, Optimization, Data Science, and also Machine Learning, continuing on to a Master's degree in Numerical Analysis enabled me to pursue my interests further. For my Master's I worked on "Convergence of the Tamed Euler and Milstein Schemes for Stochastic Differentials Equations" for my thesis. I very much enjoyed the research element of the Masterâ€™s especially the aspect of producing and developing scientific knowledge to solve real-life problems. Having learned about AIMS Rwanda and the new Data Science stream that was going to be offered, I was very happy to be awarded a place.

For my Master's at AIMS I'm working on Deep learning applied to SPDEs (Stochastic Partial Differentials Equations). Quite simply, my goal is to use deep learning techniques to solve SPDEs numerically.
